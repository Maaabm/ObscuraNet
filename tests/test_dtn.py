# Step 1: Create two secure nodes (sender and receiver)
sender = SecureNode("SenderNode")
receiver = SecureNode("ReceiverNode")

# Step 2: Exchange public keys and establish secure session
sender.establish_session("ReceiverNode", receiver.get_public_key())

# Step 3: Create DTNRouter for sender
router = DTNRouter(sender)

# Step 4: Prepare a large message to simulate file-like data
large_message = "This is a very large file or message. " * 20  # ~1000+ bytes

# Step 5: Send the message using DTN (with 30% dummy packets)

# Display count of packets sent
print(f"Total packets sent (including dummy): {len(packets)}")

# Step 6: Reassemble the message at receiver
